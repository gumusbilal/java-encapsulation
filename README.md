# Encapsulation in Java
- Hides variables from the rest of the program
- Use getter/setter methods that are public to access them

## Advantages
- Helps you to control who accesses what
  - Which function has access to a certain variable
- Makes a code flexible and easy to change
- Testing is more manageable (unit)

## Notes
- An object's behavior is exposed through methods
- Hiding internal data from the outside world
- Accessing it only through publicly exposed methods
